# ARES v1.02
### ARES is the Automated Rapid Email Sender; used for spamming and sending multiple emails to a directory of random emails using seperate name files

*This content should be used for educational purposes only.*

To launch the program you need to ensure you have a python IDE installed alongside the following modules:
> smtplib

> time

> random

To add your own personal email to the code; go to line 36 & 37 to edit the email it logs into.

***Your email and password is not logged. This program is entirely open source***

PLEASE ENSURE THAT YOU HAVE LESS SECURE APPS ENABLED (**https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps**)

After that you can run the application. You may introduce threading and modify the code to make it run faster and more efficiently; as will be done in a later update.
